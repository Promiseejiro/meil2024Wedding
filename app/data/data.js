  `Our outmost gratitude goes to God Almighty for kitting this holy matrimony between Miracle and El Favour prophetically called MIEL 2024. My first contact with El Favour Chidinma John was during the baptismal rugged, an evangelism outreach organized by the Nigerian Christian Corpers Fellowship (NCCF) at, Akwa Ibom, Nigeria.`,
  `On that faithful day, I remember her putting on a long native attire with her fancy spectacles. I guess I was photobombing her during her video because of the soothing ambiance around her. We became friends and the journey of our friendship continued through the NCCF family house where she served as an assistant general secretary and a part of the OBS team while I served as the evangelism coordinator popularly called rugged. As earlier stated, this was a mutual relationship with no strings attached or maybe she was looking at me from afar. However, I never ceased to noticed her from the sound of her voice almost every Tuesday from the OBS when she is speaking on relationship matter or the sound of her voice from the altar singing her favorite song “You have done so much for me, I cannot tell it all Nara Ekele mo (Receive my praise).`,
  `Later the year 2019, prior to my departure for studies, I can remember taking her out for a special treat. At this time greatly saw her as a special and wonderful friend. Until my departure, I can remember she was very strong, quiet and reserved. Maybe she's was missing me already. However, her constant care and love was not interupted despite been seperated by distance. Our wonderful Friendship continued to thé point of décision where we had to define our relationship. According to Ecclesiastes 4:12 NLT [12] A person standing alone can be attacked and defeated, but two can stand back-to-back and conquer. A personnal story of an overcomer has been our experience since this Journey. El Favour my Angel, my love, my Queen, my sugar, miel (honey), Her Royal Awesomeness.`,
  `I am sincerely grateful to you my love. I am indeed blessed and have a double Favour to have you as my wife. We regard this holy matrimony as a Journey of Faith and we give God all the Glory for the personal testimonies He has wrought and continue to do through this Union. `,
  `To our beloved parents, father, mother, loved ones, friends and all, we are indeed grateful to have you by our side and we are greatly honor you all. Once again, I want to say thank you to God and my beloved El Favour Chidinma. Our expectations for this is in accordance to Ephesians 3:20 “Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,”. Only what God permits will stand in this Union, Exceeding abundantly above what we can think or ask. MIEL 2024, MIEL forever - “I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.” Ecclesiastes 3:14 KJV`,
